# 🚀 Automated Release Management Setup

This document summarizes the automated release management system that has been configured for the InvenTag repository.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Automatic version.json updates** - Every release now updates version.json with:
  - New version number (semantic versioning)
  - Previous version tracking
  - Release notes with categorized commit messages
  - Release date and metadata
  - Git tag and GitHub release URLs
  - PR information (if triggered by PR)

- ✅ **Automatic commits to main branch** - The workflow now:
  - Updates version.json with new version info
  - Commits changes back to main branch
  - Creates and pushes git tags
  - Generates GitHub releases with comprehensive notes

- ✅ **Smart version bumping** based on PR labels:
  - `release:major` - Major version bump (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
  - `release:minor` - Minor version bump (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
  - `release:patch` - Patch version bump (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
  - No label = Default patch release

### 2. Repository Configuration Guide (`.github/REPOSITORY_CONFIGURATION.md`)

**Complete setup instructions for:**
- ✅ GitHub Actions permissions configuration
- ✅ Branch protection settings
- ✅ Alternative authentication methods (PAT, GitHub Apps)
- ✅ Troubleshooting common issues
- ✅ Security considerations

### 3. Automated Setup Scripts

**Repository Configuration Script (`scripts/setup/configure_repository.sh`):**
- ✅ Automated repository settings validation
- ✅ Release label creation (major/minor/patch)
- ✅ GitHub CLI integration
- ✅ Test release creation option
- ✅ Interactive setup guidance

**Version Update Test Suite (`scripts/setup/test_version_update.py`):**
- ✅ Version bumping logic validation
- ✅ Workflow file syntax checking
- ✅ Version.json format validation
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

## 🔄 How It Works

### Workflow Trigger Sequence

1. **PR Creation** with release label (`release:patch`, `release:minor`, or `release:major`)
2. **PR Merge** to main branch triggers the release workflow
3. **Version Calculation** based on current version + bump type
4. **Version.json Update** with comprehensive release information
5. **Commit to Main** with the updated version.json
6. **Tag Creation** and push to repository
7. **GitHub Release** creation with generated release notes
8. **Asset Upload** (source archives) to the release

### Version.json Structure

After each release, version.json contains:
```json
{
  "version": "2.2.0",
  "previous_version": "2.1.1", 
  "release_date": "2025-08-06T06:52:20.000000",
  "version_bump_type": "minor",
  "release_notes": "Comprehensive categorized release notes...",
  "git_tag": "v2.2.0",
  "github_release_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/tag/v2.2.0",
  "triggered_by_pr": "123",
  "pr_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123"
}
```

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### For Repository Owners

1. **Run the configuration script:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup/configure_repository.sh
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub repository settings** (follow prompts from script):
   - Enable Actions with read/write permissions
   - Configure branch protection exceptions for `github-actions[bot]`
   - Verify release labels are created

3. **Test the workflow:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/setup/test_version_update.py
   ```

### Manual Configuration (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup, follow the detailed guide in:
`.github/REPOSITORY_CONFIGURATION.md`

## 📋 Required GitHub Permissions

The workflow requires these permissions in `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write      # Update version.json and create releases
  issues: write        # Access issue information
  pull-requests: write # Read PR labels and information  
  actions: write       # Workflow management
```

## 🏷️ Release Labels

Add these labels to PRs to control version bumping:

| Label | Version Bump | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `release:major` | Major (breaking changes) | 2.1.1 → 3.0.0 |
| `release:minor` | Minor (new features) | 2.1.1 → 2.2.0 |
| `release:patch` | Patch (bug fixes) | 2.1.1 → 2.1.2 |
| *(no label)* | Default patch | 2.1.1 → 2.1.2 |

## ✅ Validation and Testing

All components have been tested and validated:

### ✅ Test Results
- **Version Update Logic**: ✅ PASS - All version bump types work correctly
- **Workflow File Syntax**: ✅ PASS - YAML syntax is valid
- **Current Version File**: ✅ PASS - version.json format is correct

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test version update logic
python3 scripts/setup/test_version_update.py

# Test repository configuration  
./scripts/setup/configure_repository.sh

# Validate workflow syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/release.yml'))"
```

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Monitor workflow runs** in GitHub Actions tab
- **Review release notes** for accuracy and completeness
- **Update PR labels** as needed for appropriate version bumping
- **Test workflow periodically** with the test scripts

### Troubleshooting
- Check `.github/REPOSITORY_CONFIGURATION.md` for common issues
- Verify GitHub Actions permissions are correctly set
- Ensure branch protection allows `github-actions[bot]` to push
- Review workflow logs in GitHub Actions for specific errors

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Configure your repository** using the provided scripts
2. **Create a test PR** with a release label to validate the workflow
3. **Monitor the first automated release** to ensure everything works correctly
4. **Enjoy automated version management!** 🎉

The release management system is now fully automated and will handle version updates every time PRs are merged to the main branch.
