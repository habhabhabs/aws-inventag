# AWS Cost Allocation Tagging Templates

This guide provides professional tagging templates that follow [AWS Prescriptive Guidance for Cost Allocation Tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html) to enable accurate cost tracking, reporting, and optimization.

## Overview

AWS Cost Allocation Tags are essential for:
- **Financial Management**: Track costs by business unit, project, or environment
- **Budget Control**: Monitor spending and identify cost optimization opportunities  
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory and organizational reporting requirements
- **Resource Governance**: Implement automated policies based on cost allocation

## Cost Reporting Templates

### Monthly Cost Report Configuration

```yaml
# cost-reporting-config.yaml
reporting:
  frequency: "monthly"
  grouping:
    primary: ["CostCenter", "Project"]
    secondary: ["Environment", "Department"]
    
  metrics:
    - total_cost
    - cost_variance
    - resource_count
    - cost_per_resource
    
  filters:
    - exclude_zero_costs: true
    - minimum_cost_threshold: 10.00
    - include_untagged: true
    
  output_formats:
    - excel
    - csv
    - json
    
  recipients:
    - finance.team@company.com
    - it.management@company.com
    - cost.center.owners
```

### Cost Optimization Recommendations

```yaml
# cost-optimization-rules.yaml
optimization_rules:
  untagged_resources:
    alert_threshold: 5  # Alert if >5% of costs are untagged
    action: "require_tagging"
    
  underutilized_resources:
    cpu_threshold: 10   # <10% CPU utilization
    duration: "7days"
    action: "rightsizing_recommendation"
    
  non_production_hours:
    environments: ["dev", "test", "staging"]
    schedule: "nights_weekends"
    action: "schedule_shutdown"
    
  storage_optimization:
    s3_lifecycle: "auto_tier"
    ebs_unused: "snapshot_and_delete"
    backup_retention: "enforce_policy"
```

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Policy Definition

Create your cost allocation policy based on organizational structure:

```bash
# Generate cost allocation policy
cp enterprise-cost-allocation.yaml config/cost-allocation-policy.yaml

# Customize for your organization
vim config/cost-allocation-policy.yaml
```

### Step 2: Validation and Enforcement

```bash
# Validate current resources against cost allocation policy
python scripts/tag_compliance_checker.py \
  --config config/cost-allocation-policy.yaml \
  --output cost_allocation_report.json \
  --format excel

# Generate cost allocation compliance report
python scripts/cost_allocation_analyzer.py \
  --input cost_allocation_report.json \
  --output cost_analysis.xlsx
```

### Step 3: Automated Remediation

```yaml
# cost-allocation-automation.yaml
automation:
  auto_tagging:
    enabled: true
    default_values:
      Environment: "dev"  # Default for untagged resources
      Owner: "unassigned@company.com"
      
  notifications:
    - type: "missing_cost_tags"
      recipients: ["resource.owners", "finance.team@company.com"]
      frequency: "weekly"
      
    - type: "cost_variance"
      threshold: 20  # >20% variance from budget
      recipients: ["cost.center.owners", "management@company.com"]
      frequency: "daily"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Naming Conventions

```yaml
naming_standards:
  cost_centers:
    format: "^[A-Z]{2,4}[0-9]{3}$"
    examples:
      - "IT001"   # Information Technology
      - "MKTG002" # Marketing
      - "FINC003" # Finance
      
  projects:
    format: "^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{2,39}$"
    guidelines:
      - "Use descriptive names"
      - "Include version numbers for major releases"
      - "Avoid abbreviations"
```

### 2. Lifecycle Management

```yaml
tag_lifecycle:
  creation:
    - "Tags must be applied at resource creation"
    - "Use Infrastructure as Code templates"
    - "Validate tags in CI/CD pipeline"
    
  maintenance:
    - "Monthly compliance audits"
    - "Quarterly policy reviews" 
    - "Annual cost center updates"
    
  deprecation:
    - "Archive old project tags"
    - "Update cost center mappings"
    - "Maintain historical data for reporting"
```

### 3. Financial Integration

```yaml
financial_integration:
  erp_systems:
    - "Map cost centers to GL codes"
    - "Automated journal entries"
    - "Budget vs actual reporting"
    
  procurement:
    - "Link purchase orders to projects"
    - "Track reserved instances"
    - "Savings plan allocation"
    
  reporting:
    - "Monthly financial statements"
    - "Department cost allocations"
    - "Project profitability analysis"
```

## Advanced Cost Scenarios

```yaml
# multi-account-cost-policy.yaml
cross_account:
  shared_services:
    account: "shared-services-123456789"
    cost_allocation:
      method: "usage_based"
      tags: ["CostCenter", "Project"]
      
  development_accounts:
    pattern: "dev-*"
    cost_allocation:
      method: "equal_split"
      charge_back: true
      
  production_accounts:
    pattern: "prod-*"
    cost_allocation:
      method: "direct_billing"
      real_time_alerts: true
```

### Reserved Instance Cost Allocation

  allocation_strategy: "cost_center_priority"
  
  priority_order:
    1: "production_workloads"
    2: "business_critical_dev"
    3: "staging_environments"
    4: "development_testing"

    test_environments:
      auto_cleanup: "7_days_unused"
      snapshot_before_delete: true
      
  rightsizing:
    enabled: true
    recommendations:
      cpu_threshold: 10
      memory_threshold: 20
      evaluation_period: "14days"
```
