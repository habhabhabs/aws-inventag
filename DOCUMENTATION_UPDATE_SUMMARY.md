## Usage Examples Added

### Basic Usage
```python
from inventag.discovery.optimized_discovery import OptimizedAWSDiscovery

discovery = OptimizedAWSDiscovery(regions=['us-east-1', 'us-west-2'])
discovery.max_workers = 6
discovery.enable_parallel = True
resources = discovery.discover_all_services()
```

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Maximum performance with parallel processing
./inventag.sh --create-excel --max-concurrent-accounts 6

# Focus on specific services
./inventag.sh --create-excel --service-filters ec2,s3,rds,lambda

# Single region for fastest discovery
./inventag.sh --create-excel --account-regions us-east-1
```
