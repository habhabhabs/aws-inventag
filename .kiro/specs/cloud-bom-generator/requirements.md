# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature represents a fundamental architectural transformation of InvenTag from a collection of standalone scripts into a unified, enterprise-grade Cloud Bill of Materials (BOM) generation platform. This is not a bolt-on addition but a complete restructuring that elevates BOM generation to a first-class feature within the InvenTag ecosystem.

The transformation leverages the battle-tested functionality in the existing scripts (`aws_resource_inventory.py`, `tag_compliance_checker.py`, `bom_converter.py`) while creating a cohesive, service-ready architecture that positions InvenTag as a comprehensive cloud governance platform.

**Current State Analysis**:
- **Proven Discovery Engine**: `aws_resource_inventory.py` provides comprehensive multi-method resource discovery across all AWS services
- **Mature Compliance Framework**: `tag_compliance_checker.py` offers robust tag validation with enterprise-grade policy enforcement
- **Professional Reporting**: `bom_converter.py` generates Excel/CSV reports with VPC enrichment and intelligent data standardization
- **Production-Ready Foundation**: All components are battle-tested in enterprise environments with comprehensive error handling

**Architectural Transformation Goals**:
- **Unified Core Library**: Extract and refactor proven functionality into a cohesive `inventag` Python package with clear module separation
- **Service-Ready Design**: Architecture that seamlessly scales from CLI tools to microservices and serverless functions
- **Enhanced BOM Generation**: Extend current reporting capabilities with advanced network analysis, security assessment, and professional document generation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing script interfaces as thin wrappers around the new core library
- **Scalable Foundation**: Modular design that supports future expansion into a full cloud governance service platform
- **Enterprise Integration**: Native CI/CD support with multi-account capabilities and audit trail generation

The result will be a service-ready platform that generates professional regulatory documentation while preserving all existing functionality and providing a foundation for future cloud governance capabilities.
