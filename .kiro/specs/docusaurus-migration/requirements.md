# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves completely migrating all existing documentation to a Docusaurus-powered documentation site that will be hosted as a GitHub Pages site within the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any documentation page THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar with organized navigation
2. WHEN a user is on a specific page THEN the system SHALL highlight the current location in the navigation
3. WHEN a user clicks on internal links THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct page within the site

3. WHEN a user navigates the site THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling across all pages
4. WHEN a user views the site THEN the system SHALL display the InvenTag logo and project information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining InvenTag, I want the Docusaurus setup to be flexible and easy to maintain, so that I can efficiently add new documentation, update content, and customize the site without complex overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria
