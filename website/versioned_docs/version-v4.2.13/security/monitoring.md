# Security Monitoring

InvenTag implements comprehensive security monitoring to continuously assess and track the security posture of the codebase and its dependencies.

## Monitoring Components

### Automated Vulnerability Scanning
- **Multi-language scanning** for Python and JavaScript/Node.js
- **Weekly scheduled scans** to detect new vulnerabilities
- **Push and PR triggers** for immediate security feedback
- **Multiple scanning tools** for comprehensive coverage

### Dependency Monitoring
- **Real-time tracking** of all project dependencies
- **Automated alerts** for vulnerable dependencies
- **License compliance** monitoring
- **Supply chain security** assessment

### Security Workflow Integration
- **SBOM generation** with every documentation build
- **CVE tracking** between versions
- **Automated issue creation** for high-severity findings
- **Security changelog** generation

## Monitoring Tools

### Python Security
- **Bandit**: Static analysis for Python security issues
- **Safety**: Known vulnerability database checking
- **pip-audit**: Advanced dependency vulnerability analysis

### JavaScript/Node.js Security  
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Retire.js**: JavaScript library vulnerability detection
- **ESLint Security**: Code-level security analysis

### Multi-Language Analysis
- **Semgrep**: Cross-language static analysis
- **Trivy**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- **Grype**: Container and dependency scanning

### Infrastructure Security
- **GitHub Actions** workflow security analysis
- **Container configuration** security scanning
- **Secrets detection** across all files

## Alert Thresholds

### High Priority Alerts
- **Critical vulnerabilities** (CVSS 9.0+)
- **High-severity issues** (CVSS 7.0+)
- **More than 20 total findings** across all tools

### Medium Priority Monitoring
- **Medium-severity vulnerabilities** (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- **10-20 total findings** requiring review
- **License compliance** issues

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Low-severity issues** for trending analysis
- **New dependency additions** for approval
- **Configuration changes** affecting security

## Monitoring Frequency

### Continuous (Every Push/PR)
- **SBOM generation** with documentation builds
- **Security scanning** on code changes
- **Dependency analysis** on package updates

### Weekly Scheduled
- **Comprehensive vulnerability scan** every Sunday
- **SBOM and CVE tracking** workflow
- **Security changelog** updates

### Release-Based
- **Version-specific SBOM** generation
- **Security impact analysis** between versions
- **Compliance documentation** updates

## Response Procedures

### High-Severity Findings
1. **Automated issue creation** with detailed information
2. **Security team notification** via GitHub alerts
3. **Priority assignment** for rapid response
4. **Remediation tracking** until resolution

### Regular Findings
1. **Documentation updates** with findings
2. **Security artifact** retention for analysis
3. **Trend analysis** for proactive management
4. **Scheduled review** during development cycles

## Security Artifacts

### Generated Reports
- **Security scan results** in multiple formats
- **SBOM files** for compliance and analysis
- **Vulnerability reports** with detailed findings
- **Security changelogs** between versions

### Retention Policies
- **Security artifacts**: 365 days for compliance tracking
- **SBOM files**: Permanent retention for historical analysis
- **Scan reports**: 90 days for operational review

## Integration Points

### GitHub Actions
- **Automated workflows** for security scanning
- **Artifact collection** and retention
- **Status reporting** and alerting

### Documentation System
- **Real-time SBOM** integration
- **Security status** in documentation
- **Historical tracking** of security posture

### Development Workflow
- **PR security checks** before merging
- **Pre-deployment scanning** for releases
- **Continuous feedback** to development team
