```text
Level 1: Business Unit
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Level 2: Cost Center  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Level 3: Project
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Level 4: Application
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Level 3: Project
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Level 4: Application
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Level 2: Cost Center
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Level 3: Project
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Level 4: Application
